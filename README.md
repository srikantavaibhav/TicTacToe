# TicTacToe
Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

This is a simple Java code for tic-tac-toe. Originally implemented in 2015 for the completion of Computer Application course under ICSE.
